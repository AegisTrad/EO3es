You take your first step into the Yggdrasil Labyrinth, filled with danger and mystery.
Strange plants cover the landscape, and the cries of beasts echo through the forest.
The fresh air and lush vegetation mask the dangers that await you ahead.
Come now into the forest, and begin your adventure!
You step into a dead end at the forest's edge, covered with brush and brambles.
An old rucksack, seemingly abandoned by a past explorer, is lying at your feet.
<!color=0007>Pick up the rucksack? <!color=0000>
You peer inside the rucksack and find a number of coins inside.
You decide it would be better to leave the old rucksack where it lies.
From this point on, your surroundings are not plotted on the map you were given.
You must take pen in hand and create a map for yourself.
The true adventure begins with your next step!
A mysterious crystal entwined with ivy blocks your path...
It seems you cannot proceed.
You find a narrow trail hidden between the trees...
But the path is too narrow for you to squeeze through.
You find a narrow trail hidden between the trees...
The path seems to have widened. It may be passable if you attempt to push through.
Continue forth?
While walking through the narrow trail, you find a trickle of water near the end.
The clear, cool water seems extremely tempting after your arduous hike.
You hesitate, unsure of whether to slake your thirst or to pass by the water.
<!color=0007>What will you do? <!color=0000>Put your hand in the water Take a sip of the water Leave
You reach out and put your hand into the spring water flowing from the rocks.
The icy water cools your heated skin.
You wonder whether you should try a sip or leave without taking action.
Cupping your hands in the stream, you bring a sip of water to your lips...
The clear, cold water quenches your thirst.
<!color=0007>The party recovered 10 TP! <!color=0000>
Feeling much better after drinking the spring water, you decide to move on.
A mysterious crystal entwined with ivy blocks your path...
It seems you cannot proceed.
You find a narrow trail hidden between the trees...
But the path is too narrow for you to squeeze through.
You find a narrow trail hidden between the trees...
The path seems to have widened. It may be passable if you attempt to push through.
Continue forth?
There's no need to explore virgin territory yet.
First seek the soldier waiting in the known areas of the forest!
As you continue down the path, you find red fruit growing on the wall of trees.
It hangs just within reach, seemingly daring you to pluck it and take a bite.
You consider for a moment whether or not to eat the fruit...
Eat the red fruit?
The fruit's sweet juices slid down <!8065>'s throat.
<!color=0007><!8065> recovered 10 HP! <!color=0000>
Wary of the mysterious fruit, you resolve not to be tempted by its bright color.
While walking through the forest, you find something furry at the trail's end.
Initially thinking it a creature, you lower your guard upon realizing it's a boot.
Could it have belonged to an adventurer?
You weigh the options of picking up the dirty boot or leaving it where it lies.
<!color=0007>What will you do? <!color=0000>Pick up the boot Look around Ignore it and leave
You gingerly pick up the dirty boot.
It's rather heavy, due to the ivory-colored rock its previous owner hid inside.
As you marvel at the rock, the ground begins to shift unnaturally.
The dreadful monsters who likely killed the boot's owner ambush you!
You thoroughly inspect the area around the boot.
A close look reveals torn clothes and reddish stains on the ground.
The signs point to dangerous beasts lurking nearby.
Eyeing the boot, you wonder whether picking it up is worth whatever danger is in store.
You decide to ignore the boot and leave this place.
As you continue down the path, you spy a blue fruit growing on the wall of trees.
Its misshapen body looks rather unappetizing.
It hangs low enough to take and eat, should you choose.
Eat the blue fruit?
<!8065> savored the taste of the delicious fruit, contrary to its twisted appearance.
<!color=0007><!8065> recovered 10 TP! <!color=0000>
As you continue into the forest, you reach a clearing.
Squarish boxes are lined up before you.
It's possible they were left by fellow explorers of the Labyrinth.
Then, they may also be part of the treasure rumored to litter the Labyrinth...
The boxes sit ready to be opened, offering no clues to their nature.
As you walk, you reach a clearing filled with blooming flowers.
The nameless flowers sway in the wind, and you catch the scent of their fragrance...
You contemplate whether to rest and enjoy their sweet smell, or leave immediately.
Rest amongst the flowers?
You decide to relax in the fragrant clearing.
However, you aren't the only creature in the forest lured by the sweet floral scent.
Before you can react, a pack of woodflies swarm around you.
Woodflies...?
Nay, these are the extremely poisonous breed known as venomflies!
Knowing that escape is futile, you brandish your weapons and prepare for battle!
You decide to vacate the sweet-smelling clearing at once.
The Yggdrasil Labyrinth...
One task must be performed before challenging its depths.
As you have some skill at adventuring, some <!color=0005>3 Skill Points<!color=0000> should be available to you.
To spend them on <!color=0005>skills<!color=0000> useful in the Labyrinth, open the Main Menu with the Y Button. Select <!color=0005>Custom<!color=0000> to allocate skill points, but think carefully before doing so.
You may already be aware of this, in which case this advice is happily unnecessary.
If so, then hesitate no longer to begin your adventure in this lush, green forest!
There's a small but carefully made gravestone.
A small flower rests upon it; no doubt it was left by someone as an offering.
As you walk through the forest, you are faced by a wall of trees.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
A small crack is visible in the wall of trees before you.
But it seems you cannot pass through from this side.
As you continue your adventure, a ferocious roar echoes through the forest.
Moments afterward, you hear heavy hoofed footsteps galloping through the forest.
A dreadful enemy unlike any you have yet seen is fast approaching!
After reaching the new floor, you suddenly remember...
Your first mission was to map B1F and present the results to Radha Hall!
It would be best to finish that task before exploring uncharted levels.
Present a completed map to Radha Hall at the first opportunity.
A mysterious crystal entwined with ivy blocks your path...
It seems you cannot proceed.
As you continue into the brush, a noise ahead draws your attention.
An intermittent sound is coming from the brush.
Something seems to be inside the tall grass before you.
You peer futilely into it, wondering whether to chance it or leave the sound alone.
<!color=0007>Investigate? <!color=0000>
As a party leader, <!8065> reached out and pushed back the tall grass.
Suddenly, <!8065>'s hand was struck by a sharp pain!
The noise seems to have come from a small snake.
After biting <!8065>'s outstretched hand, it slithered off into the forest.
<!color=0007><!8065> lost 5 HP. <!color=0000>
You pull yourselves together and continue on the adventure.
You decide to leave such a suspicious sound alone.
As you continue on the winding path, you see a soldier basking in the warm sunlight.
Noticing your presence, the soldier calls to you.
"Ho there.
Explorers, I see...
How goes your adventure thus far?"
After a brief chat, it comes out that he is here to help those navigating the forest.
The soldier offers to sell you any of his tools you find yourself in need of.
Choose the item you believe you will need most from the following:
<!color=0007>Which will you choose? <!color=0000>A weapon to battle monsters Medicine to heal the injured We're fine, thank you
You inquire of the soldier if he has any strong weapons.
Upon hearing this, the soldier removes the sword from the scabbard on his back.
"Will this serve?
It's a small sword, but I believe it will do for your purposes.
"As for the price...
Since you're licensed explorers, you may have it for 500 ental."
Pay the soldier his 500 ental, or reconsider your purchase?
<!color=0007>Pay 500en? You pay the soldier his money and receive the short sword in return.
"Best of luck, explorers, and I hope to see you again on your journey."
The transaction having been completed, the soldier bids you farewell.
You return to your own business of investigating the forest labyrinth.
Your response elicits a disappointed nod from the soldier.
"If we have no business to conduct, then farewell."
Having delivered these parting words, the soldier leaves.
You return to your own business of investigating the forest labyrinth.
You start to speak, then stop, knowing your lies of payment will be fruitless.
Disappointed, the soldier shakes his head sadly.
"If we have no business to conduct, then farewell."
Having delivered these parting words, the soldier leaves.
You return to your own business of investigating the forest labyrinth.
You tell the soldier you have need of medicine to heal wounds.
Hearing this, the soldier removes a small bottle from his pack.
"This medicine should serve your restorative needs.
"As for the price...
Since you're licensed explorers, you may have it for 100 ental."
Pay the soldier his 100 ental, or reconsider your purchase?
<!color=0007>Pay 100en? You pay the soldier his money and receive the medicine in return.
"Best of luck, explorers, and I hope to see you again on your journey."

Having delivered these parting words, the soldier leaves.
You return to your own business of investigating the forest labyrinth.
As you continue down the path, you spot an orange fruit growing on the wall of trees.
The edible-looking fruit makes your mouth water.
It would be no trouble to take the fruit and eat it.
Eat the orange fruit?
The fruit's delicious-looking exterior proved a sham, as <!8065> discovered.
<!color=0007><!8065> lost 10 TP! <!color=0000>
Wary of the unknown fruit, you leave without tasting it.
Coming to a dead end, you see a suspiciously-placed hunk of meat near the shadows.
Close examination shows that the soil nearby has been disturbed as well.
You look about your party to see if you brought along a survivalist.
A member of that class would be able to accurately assess the situation...
Is a survivalist present?
In the survivalist's estimation, the scene is obviously an animal trap.
You carefully remove the hunk of meat without touching the trap.
The meat seems to be bait to lure beasts.
It may prove useful to bring along.
Alas, wishing does not make it so. There is, in fact, no survivalist in your party.
Without one at hand, you must judge the scene for yourself.
Either venture toward the suspicious meat, or leave.
Without a survivalist at hand, you must judge the scene for yourself.
Either venture toward the suspicious meat, or leave.
Approach the hunk of meat?
<!8065> slowly approached the piece of meat...
Suddenly, the ground beneath you gives way as a wooden stake shoots at you from the brush!
<!color=0007><!8065> lost 10 HP. <!color=0000>
The tableau is revealed as a trap for beasts. <!8065> took the meat from the trap, holding onto the painful wound.
The hard-won meat may prove useful as bait.
You leave the highly suspicious meat alone.
On the tree standing at the end of the narrow trail, you see a shriveled green fruit.
Judging from its color and shape, it doesn't look edible.
If you really wish, you can pluck the fruit and eat it.
Attempt to eat the green fruit?
Appearances to the contrary, the fruit was fresh and juicy.
<!color=0007><!8065> recovered 10 HP! <!color=0000>
Unsure about the mysterious fruit, you left it alone.
<!color=0007>The dot on the map is a type of enemy known as an FOE: Foedus Obrepit Errabundus. <!color=0007>For every movement you make, it makes one as well. Consider any FOEs before taking action. <!color=0000>
As you walk through the forest, you come across two female adventurers.
One has black robes and flame hair, while the other bears a fierce look and a katana.
"Who's there!?" demands the hard-bitten woman, one hand ready to draw her katana.
The adventurers appear to be veterans, and have made no move to lower their defenses.
Perhaps they'll relent if you tell them that you are also adventurers from Etria.
<!color=0007>Tell them you are adventurers? <!color=0000>
Once you inform them you are adventurers, they nod and lower their guard ever so slightly.
"Ah, Etrian explorers.
Didn't the Radha notify you?"
The katana-wielding woman, realizing your ignorance, shakes her head in dismay.
"We have orders from the Radha to guard this place," says the severe woman with the sword.
"I am Ren, a samurai, and she is Tlachtga, a hexcaster.
"Return to town at once and get the details from Radha Hall."
Ren barks these cold, sharp words, then lapses into a silent glare.
It seems you should ask the Radha official for details regarding the situation.
The severe warrior woman gives an exasperated sigh at your refusal to speak.
"Are you men, or beasts, incapable of speech?
"This area is closed.
Return to town and take the matter up with Radha Hall.
"I am Ren, a samurai, and she is Tlachtga, a hexcaster.
We guard here under the Radha's orders."
The hard-looking woman called Ren barks the words at you coldly, with a glare to match.
It seems you should ask the Radha official for details of the situation.
Neither of the female adventurers have moved from the spot they occupy.
"We are guards, not guides," spits the katana-wielding woman.
"Take it up with Radha."
Realizing the abysmal likelihood of obtaining these women's cooperation, you turn and leave.
As you walk through the forest, you come across two female adventurers.
One has black robes and flame hair, while the other bears a fierce look and a katana.
"Who's there!?" demands the hard-bitten woman, one hand ready to draw her katana.
"This area is closed.
You lot will have to leave."
After saying this, the two women move to obstruct your path.
It seems you cannot continue forth at present.
As you walk through the forest, a wall of trees blocks your progress.
However, there seems to be a minute crack that could be passable, if you kneel.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
A small crack is visible in the wall of trees before you.
But it seems you cannot pass through from this side.
As you venture forth among the trees, the adventurer called Ren appears once more.
Smiling as if to congratulate you on your steady progress, the warrior woman greets you.
"It seems there are no wolves on this floor yet," she remarks.
"I'll give you some advice, before you go back on your way through the forest. "The trees are not always as impassable as they look.
"Finding the hidden paths will allow you to move about more efficiently.
Keep an eye out.
"There's a hidden path around here, in fact," she hints.
"See if you can spot it."
Without another word, Ren walks away.
You glance about, searching idly for the narrow, hidden path she spoke of.
After passing through the door, you reach a clearing.
Without warning, an ear-piercing scream sounds out, followed by the growl of a fierce beast.
Mere yards away, a giant wolf is preparing to spring onto an unlucky soldier!
The wounded soldier seems to be petrified with horror.
An urge to draw your weapon and save the soldier wells up within you...
<!color=0007>Rescue the soldier?
As you gird yourself for battle, the faint ringing of a bell reaches your ears...
Searching for its source, you find the hexcaster Tlachtga standing quietly there.
Her lips scarcely parting, the girl with the ringing bell murmurs a mysterious chant.
All at once, the wolf that had stood ready to pounce stops moving, its muscles tensed...
At a final word from the girl, blood spews from the wolf's jaws, and it collapses.
"They don't hear or see well," the flame-haired girl whispers, "but they can smell blood."
Fixing her pale-eyed gaze upon you, the girl approaches.
"You should be careful.
It's dangerous to fight wolves with open wounds like his."
Hand outstretched, Tlachtga sprinkles some droplets of shining water on you.
<!color=0007>Your HP and TP were recovered!<!color=0000>
"I'll tend to this soldier.
You should go on...
The stairs to the 4th floor are not far."
As she speaks, Tlachtga points you to the back of the room.
"I'll stay here until you defeat Fenrir.
Come back if your wounds become too severe."
Tlachtga turns away, her attention focused on treating the collapsed soldier's wounds.
The way is clear to continue forth.
You stand there, trying to work up the nerve to intervene.
Before you do so, the faint ringing of a bell reaches your ears...
Searching for its source, you find the hexcaster Tlachtga standing quietly there.
Her lips scarcely parting, the girl with the ringing bell murmurs a mysterious chant.
All at once, the wolf that had stood ready to pounce stops moving, its muscles tensed...
At a final word from the girl, blood spews from the wolf's jaws, and it collapses.
"They don't hear or see well," the flame-haired girl whispers, "but they can smell blood."
Fixing her pale-eyed gaze upon you, the girl approaches.
"You should be careful.
It's dangerous to fight wolves with open wounds like his."
Hand outstretched, Tlachtga sprinkles some droplets of shining water on you.
After passing through the door, you reach a clearing.
Without warning, an ear-piercing scream sounds out, followed by the growl of a fierce beast.
Mere yards away, a giant wolf is preparing to spring onto an unlucky soldier!
The wounded soldier seems to be petrified with horror.
You take a step forward...
The desire to draw your weapon and rescue the soldier wells up within you...
The flame-haired hexcaster is standing in the same place as before, her stance unchanged.
She gives you a faint nod as she turns to face you.
"How fare you?
I hope you're not pushing yourself too hard," she says demurely.
As she does, she sprinkles a few more of her shining droplets on you.
"Water from a spring deep in the forest," she explains.
"It heals your stamina."
She speaks the truth; you find your stamina restored as the cool water soaks into your skin.
"The 4th floor is home to many wolves.
Take care..."
The girl shyly turns her head away after delivering her warning to you.
Your strength regained, you feel ready to continue your adventure into the forest.
As you descend into a new floor, a premonition of bloodshed sends a chill down your spine.
Even new adventurers such as yourself can clearly feel the overwhelming sensation...
It is the specter of death, looming over you as you prepare to face unknown dangers.
Take heed!
Beasts red of tooth and claw run rampant here!
Fleeing from these creatures is no shameful thing.
In these depths, survival is paramount!
The distant howling of wolves reaches your ears as you venture deeper into the forest.
Their wild cries echo through the trees...
You suddenly recall Tlachtga's words.
She warned you that this is a dreadful place where feral wolves dwell.
You continue forth, the threat of approaching wolves uppermost in your mind...
A mysterious crystal entwined with ivy blocks your path...
It seems you cannot proceed.
As you reach the new Stratum, you find a mysterious light shining in front of you.
As you gaze upon the enigmatic scene, you hear someone descend the stairs behind you.
You turn to see two familiar adventurers with smiles on their faces.
"Well done, <!806E> explorers.
Rid of the wolves, the Emerald Grove again knows peace."
Grim satisfaction is evident on the warrior woman Ren's face as she gazes into your eyes.
"It pleases me to see such young adventurers triumph in the face of such adversity.
"After defeating Fenrir, you will be known as high- ranking adventurers of Etria.
"We salute your hard work.
May your continued exploration go as well as it has thus far."
The pleasantries thus dispensed with, Ren points to the unearthly light behind you.
In the blink of an eye, the two of them disappear from where they previously stood.
Is this the power of the Geomagnetic Field?
Ren's words stay with you as you continue...
After reaching the new Stratum, you suddenly remember...
You had undertaken a mission from the Radha to defeat Fenrir!
It would be best to report your victory over the beast before exploring this new region.
As you walk through the forest, you are faced by a wall of trees.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
A small crack is visible in the wall of trees before you.
But it seems you cannot pass through from this side.
"See that light?
We call it the <!color=0005>Geomagnetic Field<!color=0000>, and we use it to investigate the Labyrinth.
"Truthfully, no one knows what created it, or for what purpose, but its power is formidable.
"Touch it, and you will find yourself elsewhere.
The Radha's Chieftain pioneered its use.
"Though you must be eager to explore a new Stratum, I advise you to return to town first."
Ren and her flame-haired partner brush past you and approach the pillar of light.
You push through the dense plants to reach a small clearing in the forest.
Water flows between the trees here, and there are standing pools of water.
Merely by standing here, your body begins to feel lighter.
You ache to rest here...
But suddenly, you sense an ominous presence nearby.
It feels as though you are being stalked by some dangerous creature...
The sense of foreboding is enough to drive you from the spring immediately.
It may be best not to return here again.
You return to the forest spring, but the ominous presence you felt has not abated.
You cautiously take your leave from the ill-favored clearing.
You ache to rest here...
But suddenly, you sense an ominous presence nearby.
Whatever vile creature blocks the spring's water is targeting you!
As you look about, a gigantic crab steps forth from the cascading water.
Its large, sharp claws and hard shell make it seem a harder adversary than any you've faced.
You vow to stand your ground and defeat the thing to restore this spring to its natural state!
The gigantic crab silently collapses to the floor...
With that, the pools of water below you audibly begin to drain somewhere.
The crab's demise seems to have unblocked their flow to the lower regions.
Your task complete, you decide to return to the main goal of exploring the Labyrinth.
While wandering the Labyrinth, you notice odd patterns inscribed in the roots below your feet.
The obviously man-made markings are of a crossed circle, seemingly scratched in with a knife.
It's possible that another adventurer left these behind.
With no way to be certain, you elect to leave them alone.
As you walk through the forest, you are faced by a wall of trees.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
A small crack is visible in the wall of trees before you.
But it seems you cannot pass through from this side.
You obtain a crystal shard that emits a wondrous light.
It releases a low pitch and a dazzling glow, as if resonating with something...
Perhaps it opens the mysterious crystals entwined with ivy, seen elsewhere in the Labyrinth.
A shrill scream comes from the direction you face, and flapping wings are audible as well.
You break into a cold sweat, sensing the presence of a formidable enemy.
A dreadful beast unlike any you've encountered so far is lurking nearby!
Maybe Radha Hall will have some more information on it.
As you stand marveling at the jungle trees, you spot a narrow road between their trunks.
<!color=0007>Continue down the narrow road? <!color=0000>
You decide to give the narrow road a clear berth.
A mysterious crystal entwined with ivy blocks your path...
It seems you cannot proceed.
After pushing through the thick brush, you reach a place with exposed roots surrounding a bud.
The roots reach to the ceiling as if to receive something, but they do so in vain.
As you puzzle over this, you suddenly hear familiar voices approach behind you.
"Ever further do you descend into the Labyrinth, warriors of <!806E> .
We congratulate you.
The warrior woman Ren hails you, her constant companion Tlachtga standing silently by her side.
The samurai and hexcaster seem pleased with your progress thus far.
"We have a favor to ask of such accomplished explorers.
"Usually, the waters of a healing spring can be found here.
"Lately, though, the water has stopped, creating a great nuisance for adventurers.
Ren punctuates her bitter explanation with a quick point to the ceiling.
"A monster blocking the spring in the floor above is to blame.
It is tiresome and vexing.
"Warriors of <!806E> ...
Will you go to the spring, and free it from that vile monster?
"We could make short work of it ourselves, but we have other matters to attend to.
"If you mean to further explore the Labyrinth, to do this would be in your best interests.
With this, Ren and her wordless companion turn to leave.
"Luck be with you, warriors.
Gain victory over the monster, and bring honor to your guild."
With those final words, the two adventurers leave this place.
You can go defeat the monster as requested, or continue your investigation.
As you walk through the forest, you are faced by a wall of trees.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
A small crack is visible in the wall of trees before you.
But it seems you cannot pass through from this side.
A large bud's roots project from the ground in front of you.
They reach to the ceiling as if to receive something, but they do so in vain.
Perhaps if you defeat the monster to unblock the spring on the floor above...
A mysterious crystal entwined with ivy blocks your path...
It seems you cannot proceed.
A mysterious crystal entwined with ivy blocks your path...
It seems you cannot proceed.
As you walk through the jungle, you sense an imminent threat from deeper in the Labyrinth.
Something lurks here unlike anything encountered to date. It may be dangerous to proceed.
You seriously consider returning to town and making further preparations before continuing.
As you tread through the Labyrinth, you spot a red stone at your feet.
Upon closer examination, it's a mere painted pebble, and not a valuable jewel.
Certain sling-using survivalists retrieve their ammunition for expediency's sake...
This must have been colored so as to make it easier to find, once loosed at an enemy.
The ordinary stone is valueless. You lose interest immediately.
As you walk through the forest, you are faced by a wall of trees.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
A small crack is visible in the wall of trees before you.
But it seems you cannot pass through from this side.
You slowly step into the azure sea of trees.
As you take your first steps into this new land, a soldier appears and hails you.
"Are you the adventurers who defeated the King of the Jungle?
"Your exploits are the talk of Radha Hall.
You should return there to see what I mean."
The soldier smiles, delivers a mock salute, and goes on his way.
Perhaps it would be a good idea to heed his words, and visit the Radha...
In your journey through these forests, tinted blue as the ocean, you encounter a soldier.
The worry creasing his brow lifts when he sees you, and he smiles as he greets you.
"You're the adventurers sent by the Radha on the mission down here, no?
"We've been looking forward to meeting the skilled warriors who felled the King of the Jungle.
"So, you've heard that we were ordered to map the corridors of B11F and B12F.
"But with these dreadful beasts, and these twisted passages...
We were at our wits' end. "I tell you, it's a sure relief to have help from the fine members of <!806E> !"
The soldier fishes through his pack, producing a parchment.
"It isn't much, but here's the result of my work so far in mapping this floor."
The soldier hands you his hand-drawn map!
"I trust you'll have no problem filling in the rest."
Barely affording you a glance as he leaves, the soldier walks briskly back home.
Taking the soldier's partially completed map in hand, you continue your exploration.
A mysterious crystal entwined with ivy blocks your path...
It seems you cannot proceed.
In the depths of the forest, you find the oft-encountered samurai, alone for once.
She notices you as well, and turns to speak with you.
"So... You've reached the third Stratum.
You've come far... but what is it you seek?"
Ren stares coldly at you, awaiting your answer.
You ponder the question.
<!color=0007>How will you answer her? <!color=0000>To solve the mysteries To become the strongest To kill time
"The mysteries of Yggdrasil...
The reason for the Labyrinth's existence...
"You are certainly not the only explorers seeking to unravel these enigmas."
A faint smile creases the harsh warrior woman's face before she continues.
"Hear me, then. "Etria was once a small frontier town, in the days before the Labyrinth was discovered...
"But ever since then, it has become a boomtown with the influx of adventurers.
"What do you think will happen to Etria once the mysteries of the Labyrinth are solved?"
Ren's cold stare remains locked into your eyes, as though she is testing you.
"You'll do what you must, I suppose.
If you are to continue down this road..."
Ren pauses, producing a weathered scroll from her belongings. "...Then consider where such a road must eventually lead."
"If, after doing so, you decide to continue, this secret scroll of the samurai will be of use."
Ren hands you the scroll, turns to leave, and pauses before she disappears into the foliage.
"The road you walk, and mine...
They will meet again. Until then, take care."
With that, she is gone.
You give her words thought as you return to your investigation.
"To become the strongest...
One of the most basic reasons an adventurer can give.
"I must warn you, then.
"The road you walk is honorable.
But should you find it taking you to the forest's secrets...
Ren pauses, producing a weathered scroll from her belongings. "...Then consider where such a road must eventually lead."
"If you wish to become stronger, this secret scroll of the samurai will speed you to your goal."
Ren hands you the scroll, turns to leave, and pauses before she disappears into the foliage.
"The road you walk, and mine...
They will meet again. Until then, take care."
With that, she is gone.
You give her words thought as you return to your investigation.
"A flippant answer, I see.
You may as well say, 'Because it is there,' hm?"
A sly smile creases the warrior woman's face before she continues.
"Then, let me caution you.
"Idling the days aways, poking around the forest, is an acceptable road to walk.
"But do not let your idylls take you to the mysteries at the heart of this forest.
"It's in Etria's best interests that the Labyrinth's secrets remain safe.
If they do not..." Ren pauses, producing a weathered scroll from her belongings. "...Then consider where such a road must eventually lead."
"Here... this secret scroll of the samurai should provide you some amusement, I think."
Ren hands you the scroll, turns to leave, and pauses before she disappears into the foliage.
"The road you walk, and mine...
They will meet again. Until then, take care."
With that, she is gone.
You give her words thought as you return to your investigation.
You have traversed every corner of this floor and created an excellent map!
Radha Hall will be quite pleased to see your handiwork.
If you are done mapping B12F as well, then return to the Radha and show them the results.
If not, then move along to the next floor, and complete the second half of your task.
As you walk the Labyrinth's passages, you stop, feeling something odd beneath your feet.
A rusted sword and shield are buried here.
They must be the remains of expired adventurers.
Unfortunately, the atmosphere here has not been kind to them, and they appear unusable.
As you walk through the forest, you are faced by a wall of trees.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
A small crack is visible in the wall of trees before you.
But it seems you cannot pass through from this side.
You slowly step into the azure sea of trees.
You wonder if you shouldn't return to the Radha before commencing exploration here.
They may have some advice on journeying through this new and unknown Stratum.
You have traversed every corner of this floor and created an excellent map!
Radha Hall will be quite pleased to see your handiwork.
If you are done mapping B11F as well, then return to the Radha and show them the results.
If not, then return to the previous floor, and complete the second half of your task.
As you walk the Labyrinth's passages, you find a large hole at your feet.
It seems to be a nest of some kind, but nothing is emerging from it now.
You carefully tiptoe around the hole, so as not to disturb whatever sleeps there.
As you walk through the forest, you are faced by a wall of trees.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
A small crack is visible in the wall of trees before you.
But it seems you cannot pass through from this side.
After falling through the pit on the floor above, you sense something ferocious about you.
The prints in the mud and bite marks on the trees indicate that this floor is an ant's nest!
Exercise great caution as you venture forth...
It's likely that many ants will appear to stymie your passage through this floor.
As you take your first steps into a new floor, you suddenly remember...
You were given a mission to complete before venturing this far down.
It's best to return to Radha Hall immediately with completed maps of B11F and B12F.
In the depths of the forest, you suddenly catch a glimpse of someone's shadow.
From its place in a nearby brush, it closely watches your every move.
Who would be here, this deep in the Labyrinth...?
Ren and Tlachtga, perhaps?
But they are usually more direct, never hiding themselves in shadow like this...
You mentally debate over whether to approach the shadow or pay it no heed.
<!color=0007>Approach the shadow? <!color=0000>
You take a tenuous step toward the shadow, but it instantly withdraws into the trees.
You resolve to keep an eye out for the unknown shadow from now on in your travels.
You decide not to take heed of the shadow in the distance.
After a while, you reason, the shadow will lose interest in you and wander away.
Forgetting about the shadow, you continue your adventure.
As you walk through the forest, you are faced by a wall of trees.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
A small crack is visible in the wall of trees before you.
But it seems you cannot pass through from this side.
After taking your first steps into a new floor, you halt for a moment.
You recall a request at Radha Hall to investigate a mysterious organism here...
It might be wise to accept that mission before proceeding with the exploration of this floor.
You obtain a purple crystal shard that emits a wondrous light.
It releases a low pitch and a dazzling glow, as if resonating with something...
Perhaps it opens the purple crystals entwined with ivy, seen elsewhere in the Labyrinth.
...The dread monster begins to slowly fall before your eyes.
The shadow behind the collapsing horror has apparently already escaped.
But where it lurked, you find a stone tablet engraved with a mysterious language.
If it came from the unknown shadow, it may be a useful clue.
Radha Hall might know more...
As you navigate the blue forest, you sense a strong imminent threat from beyond the door.
Even with your experience thus far, the presence is stronger than anything you've faced.
Are you ready for anything?
Have you prepared yourself to confront any creature?
If you have confidence in your skills, then open the door and meet your fate!
As you walk through the forest, a wall of trees blocks your progress.
A man-made hollow is in the tree before you, waiting to receive something.
You remember the stone tablet dropped by the mysterious shadow not long ago.
Perhaps it would fit here...
You resolve to fetch it from Radha Hall's storage.
As you walk through the forest, you are faced by a wall of trees.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
As you fit the stone tablet into the tree, a dazzling light engulfs you!
When you regain your vision, you see that a new path is open to you now.
You step into yet another new Stratum.
A lonely, withered forest, unlike the other Strata you have seen, spreads before you.
It would be prudent to return to town before investigating its dusty expanses...
Radha Hall may have information regarding either the stone tablet or the mysterious girl.
Continuing through the lonely forest of flowing sands, you notice a fellow adventurer.
The black-clad, flame-haired girl notices your presence and turns to you slowly.
"You, from <!806E> ... You've come far..."
You wonder how the quiet, wide-eyed girl with the small voice came to be here.
You consider whether you should ask the shy girl, or leave her to her own devices.
<!color=0007>Ask her? <!color=0000>
You ask the hexcaster Tlachtga what has brought her to these sandy vales.
In answer, the girl's gaze shifts to the flowing sands.
"I've waited here alone for you.
I pass the time by listening to the sand..."
The flame-haired girl fixes you with her powerful, unnerving stare.
"I'm worried for Ren.
She's bound too much to her past... It will crush her someday.
"Someone must expose the truth of the Labyrinth before that happens."
The girl's hand emerges silently from her cloak, holding a small golden bell.
"This is the cursed bell of my kind.
May it aid you in your journey from here on."
The timid girl hands you the bell without another word, then goes silently on her way.
You tuck the bell into your pocket, then watch the girl until she disappears.
You match the silent gaze of the hexcaster Tlachtga.
Sensing your reluctance to speak, the girl's gaze shifts to the flowing sands.
"I've waited here alone for you.
I pass the time by listening to the sand..."
The flame-haired girl fixes you with her powerful, unnerving stare.
"I'm worried for Ren.

"Someone must expose the truth of the Labyrinth before that happens."
The girl's hand emerges silently from her cloak, holding a small golden bell.
"This is the cursed bell of my kind.
May it aid you in your journey from here on."
The timid girl hands you the bell without another word, then goes silently on her way.
Gazing at the wall of trees, you suddenly see a narrow path between those trunks.
<!color=0007>Travel down the path? <!color=0000>
You decide to ignore the path.
Beyond the narrow path, you feel a cold wind blowing through the spaces in the wall of trees.
There seems to be a clearing beyond the wall, but you have no means of getting there.
Beyond the narrow path, you feel a cold wind blowing through the spaces in the wall of trees.
Haven't you been here before...?
If so, there was certainly no such hole on your previous visit!
Whatever lurks beyond is sure to be a fierce opponent...
If you mean to continue, then take the utmost caution.
<!color=0007>Continue through the hole? <!color=0000>
At the end of the long corridor, you reach an open area.
Upon entering it, the low growl of a beast reaches your ears.
You instinctively steel yourself for combat against the gigantic monster standing before you.
The grotesque beast has an animal's body, a scorpion's tail, and a human's face.
Beating its two large wings against the dry air, it stares directly at you.
Spying an escape route, you quickly weigh whether to run or stand and fight.
As you walk through the forest, you are faced by a wall of trees.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
A small crack is visible in the wall of trees before you.
But it seems you cannot pass through from this side.
The party will barely fit through the crack in the cluster of trees ahead.
Continue forth?
As you walk through the forest, you are faced by a wall of trees.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
A small crack is visible in the wall of trees before you.
But it seems you cannot pass through from this side.
The claw marks of a large beast can be seen on the tree before you.
They seem fresh...
It's possible that the beast who made them is still close at hand.
There must be some beast in this Stratum you have not yet encountered.
Continue your exploration with great caution!
A warp point is here.
<!color=0007>Warp? <!color=0000>
You decided against using the warp point.
As you travel through the withered forest, you reach a place with a mysterious aura.
Space seems to distort beyond the hole in the tree that's barely wide enough for you.
Something unusual is sure to happen if you enter the hole.
<!color=0007>Enter the hole?
In the dense wall of trees before you is a hole that would scarcely admit a person.
You peer at it, but nothing happens.
When you open your eyes, you realize that you are standing far from your previous location.
After defeating the golden guardian bird, its glow fades as it collapses to the ground.
At last, you have overcome the guardian bird of the forest folk!
As you rest from the arduous battle, the pale-skinned girl of the forest folk appears.
Look at her?
You attempt to speak to the girl, who seems to have collapsed.
But the only answer the forest girl can give is a weak groan.
The unicorn's horn may be useful in this situation...
You avert your eyes from the collapsed forest girl.
On a battleground such as this, there is nothing you could do for her.
Give her the unicorn's horn?
You recall the unicorn horn that you obtained earlier.
If your memory serves, the horn is said to have the power to heal any wound or malady.
Perhaps it may yet save the pale-skinned girl.
You give her the unicorn's horn.
The rest is up to the forest maiden's strength.
You can do nothing more for her.
It's best to continue your journey into the Labyrinth.
Alas, you are not carrying a unicorn's horn.
Wish though you may, you cannot save the pale-skinned maiden.
She lies before you, slowly but surely growing weaker.
You can do nothing more for her. You must leave her here, and continue your journey.
You decide not to give the unicorn horn to her after all.
It seems folly to waste such a valuable item on the forest folk.
The pale-skinned forest maiden lies before you, slowly but surely growing weaker.
You can do nothing more for her. You must leave her here, and continue your journey.
Continue through the trees?
You stand before a hole that leads to the next Stratum.
A new Stratum lies past this point...
The deepest part of the Labyrinth awaits you.
But first, you must report your vanquishment of the forest folk to Radha Hall.
You check your map for the fastest way back to town.
A mysterious crystal entwined with ivy blocks your path...
It seems you cannot proceed.
"...How could the Iwaopeln have fallen to humans...?"
The pale-skinned forest maiden speaks in hushed tones as she stares balefully at you.
Her cohorts defeated and her guardian bird slain, the girl is powerless to intervene further.
Still gazing at you, the forest girl continues.
"Everything is gone... I can do nothing else.
Go below, if that is what thou desire.
"The stairs to the next Stratum are in the small area north of here.
"Take the hidden path in the wall of trees to reach it."
The forest girl casts her head down and makes to leave, bidding a final goodbye.
"Farewell, humans.
Nothing stands in thy way now; not my brethren, and not myself..."
Within moments, the pale-skinned maiden has blended invisibly with the rest of the forest.
You have carried out the mission given to you by the Radha.
You may either search for the small area the forest girl spoke of, or return to town.
As you step down into the next Stratum, strange and wonderful buildings fill your sight.
The vast underground is strewn with these unknown structures!
You look about you in speechless awe.
What could these ruins mean?
Taking care with every step, you cautiously continue onward.
While passing through the ancient buildings, you find some sort of unknown device.
The contraption of glass and metal is installed against the wall at the rear of the room.
You notice a kind of switch or button within reach on the device's center.
You consider the ramifications of turning on an unknown device inside ancient ruins...
<!color=0007>Press the button? <!color=0000>
With great trepidation, you slowly push the button...
The device gives off a sudden, unearthly grinding noise.
The low, dreadful sound echoes through the room, and you hear something moving far away.
It seems a device somewhere in these ancient ruins has been activated.
But what was it...?
You wrack your brain, trying to remember what you've seen thus far.
Though whether you recall or not, you're certain to run across it sooner or later.
You decide not to touch the unknown ancient device...
After all, there's no sense inviting danger this deep within the Labyrinth.
The control panel remains untouched.
The unknown device once again squats before you.
Nothing has changed since you first discovered it.
You consider the ramifications of turning on an unknown device inside ancient ruins...
On the ground before you lies a small, ankh-shaped piece of metal.
You have no earthly idea what value it could be to anyone.
You nudge the piece of metal with your foot; when nothing happens, you leave.
You gaze down the path connecting the ancient ruins.
Standing in the center of the long path are two figures.
As they approach, you can see that they are the adventurers Ren and Tlachtga.
"You've come all this way... but this place was never meant for humans."
The warrior woman Ren speaks, an almost sorrowful expression on her normally severe face.
"Etria depends on the constant stream of adventurers exploring the Labyrinth... You know this.
"The town only prospers from the people burning to discover the Labyrinth's secrets.
"Do you understand now?
No one must be allowed to actually solve the forest's mysteries.
"Curiosity is welcome up to a a point, but those who learn too much are troublesome...
"Thus, the Radha has charged us with eliminating you before you learn the truth of Yggdrasil."
With this, Ren slowly draws her katana, and adopts a fighting stance.
"We admire your skill... But for Etria's sake, you will not leave this Stratum alive."
The flame-haired Tlachtga moves beside her, quietly supporting her companion.
"If Ren wishes it, I will fight you with what strength I have..."
A confrontation with the two determined women before you is now inevitable.
Seeing this, you unsheathe your weapons and stand ready for battle!
Though the women's sword skills and hexes were fierce, you have emerged victorious.
Ren and Tlachtga have collapsed to the floor, exhausted.
"Visil...
We failed.
These explorers are beyond our strength," Ren mutters.
"We are beaten, adventurers.
Continue forth...
We will stand in your way no longer.
"Visil will be waiting for your arrival at the deepest floor.
"Hear from him there the truth of the Labyrinth, the forest folk, and our mission...
"I trust that you can make it there."
Saying this, the two seem more beaten than before, letting their bodies droop to the floor.
Though breathless, they continue to speak.
"Go, adventurers, and worry no more about us.
Take this and proceed onward."
Ren hands you a small piece of metal.
"Keep walking the road you believe to be true...
Your destination still lies ahead."
Raising their battered bodies, the two women support one another as they walk off.
It seems the Labyrinth's end is drawing near.
With new determination, you press on.
As the two are nearly gone, Ren turns around and comes back to you.
"Your skill defeated even we two...
I'm interested to see how strong you can become."
With these words, Ren takes an old scroll from her belongings.
"This is the secret scroll of the samurai way. I want you to have it."
Having given you the scroll, Ren once again turns her back and rejoins her companion.
As the two are nearly gone, Tlachtga turns around and comes back to you.
"I believe in you.
I know you can solve the Labyrinth's mysteries."
The girl's hand emerges silently from her cloak, holding a small golden bell.
"This is the cursed bell of my kind.
May it aid in your journey from here on."
The timid girl hands you the bell without another word, then goes silently on her way.
As the two are nearly gone, Ren turns around and comes back to you.
"Your skill defeated even we two...
I'm interested to see how strong you can become."
With these words, Ren takes an old scroll and a bell from her belongings.
"These gifts are from both of us to you.
They should help in your journey from here on."
Having given you the scroll and bell, Ren again turns her back and rejoins her companion.
You bid them farewell before returning to your travels.
Treading through the ancient ruins, you see a large tree bridging two buildings.
The outdoor landscape of lush greens and open sky calms your weary soul.
But before you can relax, you feel a powerful threat nearby!
You strain to see two figures standing in the center of the bridge, blocking your path.
If you go to meet them, you're sure to face an exceptionally fierce battle.
You glance behind you at the way leading back to town...
You must be certain you are ready to face whatever may lie in wait on the bridge.
You climb down the stairs in the mysterious ruins...
As you step off the last stair, a wall directly in front of you obstructs your path.
Before you turn to head back, you notice a paper, yellowed with age, lying on the floor.
You can vaguely make out words on the paper, which seems on the verge of disintegrating.
Holding the paper to the window for light, you examine the blurred writing...
You climb up the stairs in the mysterious ruins...
As you step off the last stair, a wall directly in front of you obstructs your path.
Before you turn to head back, you notice a paper, yellowed with age, lying on the floor.
You can vaguely make out words on the paper, which seems on the verge of disintegrating.
"We... seven... our staff... inaugurated... save... Earth... ...destruction..."
Before you can make out the entire message, the paper turns to dust in your hand...
It must have been an extremely old letter.
As nothing else here catches your eye, you decide to leave this place.
On the ground before you lies a small, ankh-shaped piece of metal.
You have no earthly idea what value it could be to anyone.
You nudge the piece of metal with your foot; when nothing happens, you leave.
"To save... this Earth... Yggd...
Project..."
"Wife waiting...
Japan... must... nue... research...
For... ake... mankind..."
Before you can make out the entire message, the paper turns to dust in your hand...
It must have been an extremely old letter.
As nothing else here catches your eye, you decide to leave this place.
You continue down the corridor in the mysterious ruins...
At the immediate end of the corridor is a wall obstructing your path.
Before you turn to head back, you notice a paper, yellowed with age, lying on the floor.
You can vaguely make out words on the paper, which seems on the verge of disintegrating. "...last... left... I...
Yggdrasil... caught in... eter... life..."
"Only worry about...
Visil... husband... left alone... he's..."
"Solitude... person... It's... ...st... cruel..."
Before you can make out the entire message, the paper turns to dust in your hand...
It must have been an extremely old letter.

On the ground before you lies a small, ankh-shaped piece of metal.
You have no earthly idea what value it could be to anyone.
You nudge the piece of metal with your foot; when nothing happens, you leave.
As you tread what seems to be the deepest part of the forest, you find a massive door.
You reach for its control panel, but stop when a voice suddenly speaks out.
Ask what lies beyond the door?
"Beyond that door...?"
The Chief barks a hollow laugh, and seems to choose his next words very carefully.
"Why, the truth of Yggdrasil.
Will you be the ones to finally witness the Labyrinth's secret?"
His tone becomes harsh, as if to reproach you for daring to ask.
"If you wish to know the things I know, then by all means, go through the door.
"But if you're not willing to stake your life on the truth, then don't waste your time."
The Chieftain falls silent, then slowly disappears beyond the door standing before you.
You reach the depths once again to find the Chieftain awaiting you in front of the door.
"Not satisfied, then?
You still wish to learn what secrets lie beyond this door?"
The Chieftain puts on a strained smile as he answers.
"Why, the truth of Yggdrasil.
Will you be the ones to finally witness the Labyrinth's secret?"
His tone becomes harsh, as if to reproach you for daring to ask.
"If you wish to know the things I know, then by all means, go through the door.
"But if you're not willing to stake your life on the truth, then don't waste your time."
The Chieftain falls silent, then slowly disappears beyond the door standing before you.
"I thought not.
No, there's no need to worry yourselves over such things."
The Chieftain looks at you with a triumphant smile.
"You've already achieved so much.
No one could have expected more from you.
"You can go back to town, proud men. The Chieftain watches you walk the path back to town."
"If you enter, be prepared. In exchange for your lives, I will tell you the Labyrinth's secret."
The door swings firmly closed on the Chieftain's words.
Your heart pounding, you think carefully before deciding your next move.
There is still time to prepare in town before pursuing the Chieftain through the door...
You think hard on your party's current status, debating if the time has come to proceed...
The decision to go past that point of no return can only be made by you.
As you walk through the forest, you are faced by a wall of trees.
<!color=0007>Continue forth?
A small crack is visible in the wall of trees before you.
But it seems you cannot pass through from this side.
You explore the corridor behind the hall where you once fought the Lord of Yggdrasil...
Believing everything to be over, you're surprised to see a man-sized hole in the floor.
As you peer into it, you realize it leads to another Stratum you have never seen.
It seems your adventure has not yet ended!
Your heart racing in your chest, you stand poised to explore the unknown Stratum!
You produce the Card Key given to you by the two adventurers.
As you bring it near the door, the noise of a lock lifting sounds through the passage.
"Mark well my words before you open that door."
The Chieftain whom you spoke to so often at Radha Hall appears, a grave look on his face.
He moves to stand between you and the door as he speaks.
"You have done well to defeat such skilled warriors as the forest folk, Ren, and Tlachtga.
"Truly, none who have traveled the Yggdrasil Labyrinth are your equals.
"Return to town, and you'll receive fame and fortune. You don't have to do anymore."
The Chieftain's promise tempts you, but your gaze is still drawn to the massive door...
You stand torn between taking him up on the offer, and finding the truth behind the door.
There is a mysterious space which feels different from what is around you.
You wait expectantly, but nothing seems to be happening here now.
From this point on, you will not be able to turn back.
Are you willing to proceed?
<!color=0007>Continue onward?
From this point on, you will not be able to turn back.
Are you willing to proceed?
<!color=0007>Continue onward?
There is a mysterious space which feels different from what is around you.
<!color=0007>Will you try entering it?
You reach the true depths of the Yggdrasil Labyrinth's ominous red caverns...
Before you squats an abomination born from your most terrible nightmares.
The monster dwelling in these blood-soaked depths must be the Labyrinth's final enemy!
Unsheathing your weapons, you prepare to face the heart of the Labyrinth!
You stand within the ominous lowest reaches of the Labyrinth, surrounded by red walls...
There, you reach a door that seems to lead into the deepest parts of the Labyrinth.
A seal fashioned after a dragon's face is carved on it.
As you reach out to touch the door, a mysterious voice rings inside your head.
"Only those who have bested the Labyrinth's mightiest behemoth shall earn passage here.
"That mightiest of beasts is... "<!color=0006>The Grand Wyrm. <!color=0007>"If thou would challenge the transcendent one in the depths, first defeat its guardian!"
The mysterious voice withdraws from your head...
It seems you cannot yet pass through this door.
As you reach out to touch the door, a mysterious voice rings inside your head.
"Only those who have bested the Labyrinth's marvelous creature shall earn passage here.
"That most marvelous of beasts is... "<!color=0006>The Majestic Drake. <!color=0007>"If thou would challenge the transcendent one in the depths, first defeat its guardian!"
The mysterious voice withdraws from your head...
It seems you cannot yet pass through this door.
As you reach out to touch the door, a mysterious voice rings inside your head.
"Only those who have bested the Labyrinth's fearsome creature shall earn passage here.
"That most dreaded colossus is... "<!color=0006>The Terrible Dragon. <!color=0007>"If thou would challenge the transcendent one in the depths, first defeat its guardian!"
The mysterious voice withdraws from your head...
It seems you cannot yet pass through this door.
As you approach, the seal on the door slowly fades away.
Nothing more stands in your path! The way is clear to continue forth!
It seems as though you can push through this scarlet, blood-drenched wall...
But there is no guarantee of safe return once you have breached its confines.
You gather your courage to challenge the very deepest part of the Labyrinth...
